#BrazMogu LÖVE

A LÖVE2D based sub-engine/suite for developing games in Lua.

Includes a whole API of utilities and architecture for easy setup of small game projects such as prototypes or jam works.

# LÖVE2D

For the original LÖVE2D, visit the official site at http://love2d.org. It's a very neat engine. :)

[Here there will be a quick rundown of how to work with the BrazMogu variant of LÖVE.]
